Data science notebook's for EDA with different datasets and for me to improve my understanding of EDA.

nba2k20_EDA - I was always a fan of basketball and NBA2k20 is one of the few NBA2k video games that i played so it piques my interest to analyse the NBA players based in the NBA2k20 game. This dataset is obtained on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/isaienkov/nba2k20-player-dataset. The notebook is for Data Visulisation and an analysis on the correlation of the attributes in the dataset.

HR_EDA - This notebook is done to explore my data visulisation and my knowledge on one of the most used machine learning algorithm (logistic regression).
